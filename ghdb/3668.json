This name is often also \n\nused for the login to ftp and shell access, which exposes the system to \n\nattack. There is also an undisclosed flaw in version 1.3 of the software, as \n\nthe author has mentioned in version 1.4 as a security fix, but does not tell \n\nus what it is that was patched.\n\n\n\n \n\nAuthor: DigiP",
