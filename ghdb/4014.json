It is supplied as a PHP script called\n\ndbg-wizard.php which when placed in the root folder of a web site and\n\nexecuted provides instructions to the user about setting up their web\n\nserver so the debugger can be used.\n\n\n\nIt is not meant to be present on a live site as it exposes details\n\nabout software configurations and versions which might allow an\n\nattacker to discover other vulnerabilities. If the DBG shared library\n\nis also installed it will expose that fact and potentially assist an\n\nattacker in crafting a request to start a debug session in which they\n\ncould do anything that can be done through a PHP script, including\n\nreading files and accessing database entries.\n\n\n\n--\n\nAlfred Armstrong\n\n",
