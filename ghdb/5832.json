If attacker inserts victim's username along with\nattacker's email address, than attacker might receive password reset link\nor code for the target user on his(attacker) own mail. Or, if attacker\nattempts password reset for his own account, then intercept and modifies\nthe http request body with victim credentials(i.e. username, email), than\nhe might successfully reach victim's password reset page. Using these two\nmethods, attacker might be able to takeover any user account.\n\n# Date: 25/03/2020\n\n# Author: Rafin Rahman Chowdhury\n",
