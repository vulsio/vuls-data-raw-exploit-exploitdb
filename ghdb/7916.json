  "textual_description": "# Dork: intitle:\"HFS\" AND intext:\"httpfileserver 2.3\" AND\n-intext:\"remote\"\n# Author: Alexander Ahmann\n# Email: hackermaneia@riseup.net\n# Date: 11 March, 2022\n# Category: Vulnerable Servers\n\nThapa (2016) devised an exploit targeting version 2.3 of Rejetto.com\n(n.d.)'s \"HTTP File Server.\" Thapa included the Google dork\n'intext:\"httpfileserver 2.3\"' as a means to find webservers on the\ninternet running the vulnerable service. However, there is a limitation\nwith this dork, as it instructs Google's search engine to list websites\nwhich includes web pages with the text \"httpfileserver 2.3\" in it. This\nwill cause Google search to report security bulletins discussing the\nvulnerability.\n\nTo mitigate this problem, I present a slight modification of Thapa's\nGoogle dork to \"filter out\" said security bulletins: 'intitle:\"HFS\" AND\nintext:\"httpfileserver 2.3\" AND -intext:\"remote\"' (without single\nquotes, with double quotes). Elaborating on the components of my\nmodified Google dork:\n\n1. 'intitle:\"HFS\"' will report web pages with the string \"HFS\" in the\n metatag. This is a feature that I have identified unique to\nRejetto.com (n.d.)'s HTTP File Server.\n2. 'intext:\"httpfileserver 2.3\"' will report web pages with the string\n\"httpfileserver 2.3\" in its body. This is a feature that Thapa (2016)\nidentified in Rejetto.com (n.d.)'s HTTP File Server.\n3. '-intext:\"remote\"' will \"filter out\" web pages with the string\n\"remote\" in its body. I have identified this string as a feature of\nsecurity bulletins reporting on the Rejetto.com (n.d.)'s HTTP File\nServer vulnerability.\n\nThe \"AND\" boolean operator is used to narrow down the search results and\ndecrease the rate of false positives.\n\nReferences\n----------\nRejetto.com (n.d.).
