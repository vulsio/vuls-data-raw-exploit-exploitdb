Removing words like \"example\" and \"test\" removes the\nnumber of keys that are published on purpose for demonstrations.\n\nThis will produce a LOT of github results. If you want to look for other\nsites that may have accidentally published keys, add \"-site:github.com\" or\n\"-github\"\n\nHappy hunting.\n\n-oni49\n",
