I tried just using this string along with the inurl portion, but it seemed to inappropriately restrict the search. Couple this with [3] and, um, yeah.cykyc[1]http://www.scriptarchive.com/wwwboard.html[2]http://www.scriptarchive.com/faq/wwwboard.html#q2[3]http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=625",
