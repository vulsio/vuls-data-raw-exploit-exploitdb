	"textual_description": "Dork:\nintitle:\"Apache Struts 2.5\" \"index of /\" -git\nExplanation:\nintitle:\"Apache Struts 2.5\": This part specifies that the search results\nmust have the words \"Apache Struts 2.5\" in the title. It helps narrow down\nthe results to instances related specifically to Apache Struts version 2.5.\n\n\"index of /\": This part looks for directories with the \"index of /\" string.\nSuch directories often contain a listing of files and folders, which could\nbe unintentionally exposed and may include sensitive information.\n\n-git: This part excludes results that contain the term \"git\". The idea is\nto filter out Git repositories from the search results, focusing on other\ntypes of exposed directories.\n\n*Sample output : *\nhttps://mirror.softaculous.com/apache/struts/2.5.30/\nhttps://ftp.unicamp.br/pub/apache/struts/2.5.25/\nhttps://ftp.itu.edu.tr/Mirror/Apache/struts/2.5.32/\nhttps://repository.jboss.org/maven2/apache-struts/struts/\nhttps://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache/struts/\nhttps://ftp.riken.jp/net/apache/struts/\nhttps://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/apache/struts/\n\n This Google dork is searching for instances where the title includes\n\"Apache Struts 2.5,\" and the webpage has a directory listing (\"index of /\")\nbut excludes any results related to Git repositories. The aim is to\nidentify potentially exposed Apache Struts 2.5 instances that might have\nunintentionally revealed directory structures.\n\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nAffected versions: Struts 2.x before 2.5.33 or 6.x before 6.3.0.2\nDescription: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-50164\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\n-- \n*Parth Jamodkar*\n\n*CLoud security researcher 3*\n*LinkedIn* ",
