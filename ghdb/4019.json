You can simply read them in a text editor(You'll see the header and\n\nthen the database content in plain text) or you can convert them(to xml,\n\nexcel, ...) with free software. In order to convert them, you also need the\n\nlinked index file (.NDX) and optional mmo file which are located in the\n\nsame directory.\n\nSome Windev/Webdev installations store usernames and other sensitive\n\ninformation in that kind of file.",
