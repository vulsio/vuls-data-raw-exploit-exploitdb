	"textual_description": "Webmasters wanting to exclude search engine robots from certain parts of their site often choose the use of a robot.txt file on the root of the server. This file basicly tells the bot which directories are supposed to be off-limits.An attacker can easily obtain that information by very simply opening that plain text file in his browser. Webmasters should *never* rely on this for real security issues. Google helps the attacker by allowing a search for the \"disallow\" keyword.",
