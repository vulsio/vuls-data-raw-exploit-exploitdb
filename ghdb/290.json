On Apache and NCSA Web servers the file is .htaccess, on Netscape servers it is .nsconfig.These files associate users, groups, and IP addresses with various levels of permissions: GET (read), POST (execute), PUT (write), and DELETE. For example, a FrontPage author would have permission to use HTTP POST commands (to save new content), and a user with browse permissions would be permitted to use HTTP GET commands (to read content).",
