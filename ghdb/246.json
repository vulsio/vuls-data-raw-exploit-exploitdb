	"textual_description": "WS_FTP.LOG can be used in many ways to find more information about a server. This query is very flexible, just substitute \"+htpasswd\" for \"+FILENAME\" and you may get several hits that you hadn't seen with the 'normal' search. Filenames suggested by the forum to explore are: phpinfo, admin, MySQL, password, htdocs, root, Cisco, Oracle, IIS, resume, inc, sql, users, mdb, frontpage, CMS, backend, https, editor, intranet . The list goes on and on..A different approach might be \"allinurl: \"some.host.com\" WS_FTP.LOG filetype:log\" which tells you more about who's uploading files to a specific site.",
