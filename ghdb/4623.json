Aliases can be declared in bash files. These aliases will\nlast as long as our shell session is present.\n\nTo create an alias insert the following command in to .bashrc file\n\n*alias alias_name=\"command_to_run\"*\n\nApache server comes with a default offline .bashrc file which can be\nexploited further if the alias commands are found.\n\n*Remediation:*\n\n1. Disable Directory listing in the server.\n2. Remove .bashrc files in the production server or remove the Read / Write\npermission of the file through internet.\n\n*Author: *Melvin Varkey\n",
