The Cyclades TS1000 and TS200 devices are Console servers, based on a cut down Linux version. These lovely devices sit on the network with console cables attached to them, so that you then gain access to this device, and then have console access to any of the hosts connected to the console ports. :-)The default username and password for these devices is, root/tslinux.This query currently only returns pages available in Google's cache (but in the future more devices may be returned).",
