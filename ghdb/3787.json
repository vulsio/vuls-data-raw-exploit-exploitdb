Most people use it for cable TV so that\n\nthey don't have to spend rent money on a low end quality hardware DVR\n\nfrom their cable company. It's default config has no password or\n\nusername enabled. Very bad for people who connect their PCs directly to\n\ntheir modems. I have Beyond TV and I was curious on how secure it is.",
