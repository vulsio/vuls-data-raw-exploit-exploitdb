PHP is allowed, thus this leads to unauthenticated arbitrary file upload and remote code execution.\nIt seems that this vulnerability was originally discovered and published publicly on Twitter on August 26th (see references), and was later seen being exploited in the wild by Seravo.\n\nBest regards,\nbt0",
