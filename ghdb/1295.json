However if the computer the calender script is on doesn't support the crypt function the are plaintext. Changing calender dates might not sound useful but people reuse passwords so who knows? Also search for the logins:intitle:\"Calendar Administration : Login\" | inurl:\"calendar/admin/index.asp\" -demo -demos Then to get the passwords change the url fromwxw.calendersiteexample.com/thissite/calendar_admin.cgitowxw.calendersiteexample.com/thissite/calendarscript/users.txt The defaults are anonymous/anonymous and Administrator/Administrator.",
