Due to an input validation error in Plesk Server Administrator, it is possible for a remote attacker to make a specially crafted web request which will display PHP source code. This is acheivable by connecting to a host (using the IP address rather than the domain name), and submitting a request for a known PHP file along with a valid username. http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/3737",
