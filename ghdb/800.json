It is also useful for people wanting to gain some clues into a tracker's/site's setup. People targetting BitTorrent trackers because of the questionable legality of their general usage may also find this query useful!Often, the URL involved can be changed to access the configuration / installation / deletion script.. which are obviously *not* intended for public access, even if the statistics page is.",
