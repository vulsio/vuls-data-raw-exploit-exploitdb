Take clues from the location of the file as a possible pointer to exactly which program is producing the file. The file's date and time can also help if you know which programs you were running when the file was written.\"The most common use is the \"vCalendar File\", used by Outlook for example. It can also belong to a \"Palm vCal Desktop Application\".
